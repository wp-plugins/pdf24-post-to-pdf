A plugin to create PDF files of articles in your blog.



== Description ==

This plugin enables your blog readers to create PDF files of one or more articles in your blog. To realize that a little box is shown below or above
every article, in a sidebar, on the top or bottom of a page or wherever you want in your wordpress blog by inserting a peace of code in a template.

The plugin provides two modes to create PDF files. The first mode is the email mode. In that mode each box has a field in which a visitor
can enter an email address to which the created PDF will be sent. The second mode is the direct download mode. No email address is needed
in that mode. Each PDF box or each PDF link creates the PDF directly and the user can download the created PDF file.

A PDF box or a PDF link below or above each article creates a PDF file with the corresponding article only. A PDF widget box in the sidebar
or above or below all articles creates a PDF file with all articles on the current page.

The PDF boxes, PDF links and the format of the PDF file can be highly customized by CSS and templates. Furthermore you can configure a lot of
other parts of the plugin by editing the plugin settings which are provided in your Wordpress admin area.

Your server or your webspace, where your blog is hosted, does not need any special modules to run this plugin. Just install it and it will work.

Custom fields are supported. Look at the installation and FAQ section to get more information about that.

* Download the PDF file or send it to an email address
* Supports PDF articles bars, sidebars, top/bottom bars and PDF links
* The plugin and the PDF file is highly customizable

== Installation ==

= Main Installation =
1. Unpack the plugin zip archive in your wordpress plugin folder `/wp-content/plugins/` or use your Wordpress plugin manager to download the plugin.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress admin area
1. Configure the plugin in wordpress admin area Settings->PDF24 Plugin

By default the PDF plugin is configured to display a small PDF box below each article. You can change that in the plugin settings in your Wordpress admin area.
The PDF plugin can display a box above or below each article, in the sidebar, on top or bottom of each page or you can place
a PDF link everywhere in your blog. To enable or disable some of these boxes simply change the plugin settings.


= PDF Sidebar Widget =
If you want to use the PDF sidebar widget you have to enable the sidebar plugin. Then open the widget section in Wordpress admin area and put the widget
into the sidebar.


= PDF Top/Bottom Bar =
If you want to use the PDF top/bottom box, the link plugin or if you want to show a sidebar box without using the widget then you have to insert
some peace of code into a template file where the box or the link shall appear.

Insert the following code into the theme file `header.php`, `footer.php` or an other one, where the top/bottom PDF bar shall appear.
`<?php pdf24Plugin_topBottom(); ?>`


= PDF Link =
Insert the following code into any theme file, where you want to display a PDF link which creates a PDF file with one or more articles in you blog.
`<?php pdf24Plugin_link(); ?>`


= PDF Sidebar Box =
Insert the following code into any theme file, where you want to display a PDF sidebar box by which users can create a PDF file with the articles
on the currently displayed page.
`<?php pdf24Plugin_sidebar(); ?>`


= Custom Fields Support =
If you use custom fields and if you want it to be part of the PDF file then you have to add some codes to your template files to mark the content
so that the PDF24 plugin knows what the content is. This can be done like the following:

	<?php pdf24Plugin_begin(); ?>
	<?php the_content(); ?>
	... Your custom fields code ...
	<?php pdf24Plugin_end(); ?>
	<?php pdf24Plugin_post(); ?>
	
The above call to *pdf24Plugin_post()* can be replaced with *pdf24Plugin_link()* or *pdf24Plugin_topBottom()* or *pdf24Plugin_sidebar()*. Each of these
methods shows a different box depending on what you want. Also look at the FAQ section to get more information about custom fields support.

If you have any problems with the installation or the custom fields support feel free to contact us.

After that code insert this small peace of code:
`<?php pdf24Plugin_topBottom(); ?>`

= Does the plugin support the Wordpress widget system? =

Yes. Open the plugin settings and enable the Wordpress widget plugin. Then open the widget manager and you will see the PDF24 plugin.
Add the PDF24 widget to the sidebar or any other widget place.

= How to add Wordpress Custom Fields to the PDF file =

Normally, the PDF24 plugin only uses the contents of the articles as content for the PDF file. Custom fields are extra information, that is
normally not part of the content itself but can be used in templates to present extra information. To tell the PDF24 plugin what content shall be part
of the PDF file, you have mark up the content area within Wordpress theme files with special PDF24 plugin methods.

To mark up the content, do this:

	<?php pdf24Plugin_begin(); ?>
	<?php the_content(); ?>
	... Your custom fields code here...
	<?php pdf24Plugin_end(); ?>
	
The above code tells PDF24 that the content is the articles content itself and the rest of the content between the two methods. You can place or
output any other custom fields or information between the *pdf24Plugin_begin* and *pdf24Plugin_end* method. All that content between the two method
is added to the PDF file.

All PDF24 plugin PDF bars, links and boxes automatically uses this information to create the PDF file. Special care must be taken when you use the
article bars which is automatically added to the content of each article. If you use the above markup code then the article bars will be removed
from the content and you have to insert some extra code where the article bar shall appear.

This extra code is the following:
	<?php pdf24Plugin_post(); ?>
	
A sample code section of my test *loop.php* template file looks like this:

	<?php pdf24Plugin_begin(); ?>
	<?php the_content(); ?>
	<?php the_meta(); ?>
	<?php pdf24Plugin_end(); ?>
	<?php pdf24Plugin_post(); ?>

This new code tells the PDF24 plugin what content is to add to the PDF file. This is the outputs of the codes which are placed inside
the *pdf24Plugin_begin* and *pdf24Plugin_end* methods. The next line, the call to the method *pdf24Plugin_post*, outputs the article PDF bar which
the user have to use to generate the PDF file. If you don't call the *pdf24Plugin_post* method then the article bar will not be shown. You can omit this
call when you use the PDF top/bottom bar, the PDF sidebar, the PDF widget or a PDF link.

The above call to *pdf24Plugin_post()* can be replaced with *pdf24Plugin_link()* or *pdf24Plugin_topBottom()* or *pdf24Plugin_sidebar()*. Each of these
methods shows a different box depending on what you want. Replacing *pdf24Plugin_post()* with *pdf24Plugin_link()* will output a *Download as PDF* link
instead of the bigger article bar. The above code could also look like the following one:

	<?php pdf24Plugin_begin(); ?>
	<?php the_content(); ?>
	... Your custom fields code here...
	<?php pdf24Plugin_end(); ?>
	<?php pdf24Plugin_link(); ?>
	
You can place the *pdf24Plugin_link()* call where you want. This can be directly after the content, in the entry utility area or everywhere else in the template.

This feature makes PDF24 a very powerful PDF generator. You can generate the PDF file of nearly every content in you blog.
