A plugin to convert articles to PDF. Visitors can make a copy of articles in form of a PDF. Contents in created PDF files are linked with your blog.

== Description ==

This plugin enables your readers to convert one or more articles to pdf files. Therefore a little box is shown below every article, 
in the sidebar or on the top or bottom of each page in your wordpress blog.

The plugin provides two modes to create PDF files. The first mode is the email mode. In that mode each box has a field in which a visitor
has to enter an email address to which the created PDF will be sent. The second mode is the direct download mode. No email address is needed
in that mode. Each PDF box or each PDF link creates the PDF directly and the user has to download the created PDF.

A PDF box/link below or above each article creates a PDF only of the approriate article. A PDF widget box in the sidebar or above or below all
articles creates a PDF from all articles on the page.

The PDF boxes, PDF links and the format of the PDF file can be customized by CSS. Furthermore you can configure some other parts
of the plugin. Plugin settings are provided in Wordpress admin area in settings section.

== Installation ==

1. Unpack the plugin zip archive in your wordpress plugin folder `/wp-content/plugins/`
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress admin area
1. Configure the plugin in wordpress admin area Settings->PDF24 Plugin

By default the plugin is configured to display a small PDF box below each article. You can change that in settings.
The plugin can display boxes above or below each article, in the sidebar, on top or bottom of each page or you can place
a PDF link everywhere in your blog. To enable or disable some of these boxes simply change the plugin settings.

If you want to use the sidebar widget you have to enable the sidebar plugin. Then open the widget section and put the widget
into the sidebar.

If you want to use the top/bottom box or the link plugin you have to insert some peace of code into a template file
where the box or the link shall appear.


Insert the following code into the theme file `header.php` or `footer.php`, where the top/bottom PDF bar shall be shown.

`<!-- Start pdf24.org top/bottom plugin -->`
`<?php pdf24Plugin_topBottom(); ?>`
`<!-- End pdf24.org top/bottom plugin -->`

Insert the following code into any theme file, where you want to display a PDF link.
